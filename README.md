##About
- This was created week 6 out of 24 into the Galvanize Full Stack Development Bootcamp
- Simply put, this application has form validation and database connection, all connecting the user to a final page with an html5 game

###Game controls
- the arrow keys move the player left, right, up, and down respectively.
- The space bar fires bullets at enemies who are, in turn, firing back at you.
- My heroku deployment is not yet complete, I think there are some dependencies not listed and I will fix this asap.

###Heroku link
- https://stark-eyrie-9677.herokuapp.com/
- again once this is up and running I will edit out the last bullet point under game controls.
